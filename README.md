# UnixShellProject
operating system course project
a shell for unix wrritten in C using processes with support fo standard shell commands with up to 3 arguments (with the option to expand the max argument number)
We developed a custom shell system in Unix to perform additional tasks that are not available in the standard Unix shell. This shell system extends the functionality of the base shell by incorporating features and utilities that enhance user productivity and automate processes that would otherwise require manual intervention or additional scripting
